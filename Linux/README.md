This is the Linux version's source code

Linux releases will always be in the main repository, numbered x.1.x in the main repository's releases

4.1.5 is the latest x.1.x version

Just about any GUI Linux version released in the last 20-25 years should work

Build instructions:
- Please unzip the folder and then cd into the Linux folder within the extracted folder in a terminal
- Type `sudo ./configure && make && sudo make install` to build from source and install
- You can use `sudo make upgrade` instead of `sudo make install` to directly update your existing installation
